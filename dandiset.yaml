description: "2-photon imaging and behavioral data from hippocampal area CA1 during
  virtual reality navigation in mice. Included in Sosa, Plitt, & Giocomo, \"A flexible
  hippocampal population code for experience relative to reward,\" Nature Neuroscience.\n
  \nTo reinforce rewarding behaviors, events leading up to and following rewards must
  be remembered. Hippocampal place cell activity spans spatial and non-spatial episodes,
  but whether hippocampal activity encodes entire sequences of events relative to
  reward is unknown. To test this, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal
  CA1 as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations.
  When the reward moved, a subpopulation of neurons updated their firing fields to
  the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing behavioral timescale
  sequences spanning the entire task. Over learning, this reward-relative representation
  became more robust as additional neurons were recruited, and changes in reward-relative
  firing often preceded behavioral adaptations following reward relocation. Concurrently,
  the spatial environment code was maintained through a parallel, dynamic subpopulation
  rather than through dedicated cell classes. These findings reveal how hippocampal
  ensembles flexibly encode multiple aspects of experience while amplifying behaviorally
  relevant information."
